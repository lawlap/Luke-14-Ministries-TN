            <p>
              The first day and a half of camp for STMs (short term
              missionaries) is filled with training to ensure you are equipped
              to effectively serve our families affected by disabilities. There
              will be plenty of time to ask questions! You will likely be a
              buddy assigned to a camper who has a disability. You will be
              there to help them, get to know their family, and give your
              camper the best Family Retreat possible! (You will not be
              required to help with the toileting needs of your buddies)
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are not assigned a specific camper, you&rsquo;ll be
              assigned as a helper in one of the program areas. You&rsquo;ll
              find out this assignment during your first day of training.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will stay on campus in an assigned bunkhouse or cabin with
              other volunteers for your home away from home.
