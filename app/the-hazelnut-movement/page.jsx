We never want cost to hold you back from bringing this message to your students. Thanks to our generous donors and sponsors, we’re often able to reduce or fully cover program fees through grants or sponsorships.',

    question: 'What age group is the assembly best for?',
    answer: [
      'Our school assembly is designed for Kindergarten through 5th grade students. While all age groups are positively impacted, we find that 2nd to 5th graders often connect with the message on a deeper level.',
      'To ensure the content is developmentally appropriate, we usually divide the presentation into two groups:',

    question: 'What is the main message of the assembly?',

We encourage students to discover and embrace their superpower—that one thing they’re truly gifted at. Rather than focusing on weaknesses or what makes them different, we help them see their challenges—and the challenges of others, including those impacted by disability—as a potential strength.',

              The Hazelnut Movement was started in 2022 by Julia Erman. She
              embarked on a mission to provide parents and educators with
              resources to help them teach their children about other children
              with special needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having been a special needs parent with two children affected by
              a very rare genetic disorder within the NKH family, she come to
              realize that many parents and educators lack the knowledge of how
              to discuss children with special needs. Some fear saying the
              wrong thing, while others simply avoid the topic due to a lack of
              proper guidance. This is where the Hazelnut Movement steps in!
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that storytelling is the catalyst for compassion. One
              book at a time, we aim to initiate those crucial conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you haven&rsquo;t yet explored our selection of books, I
              encourage you to do so. I assure you that each page will warm

            We share stories, encourage questions and inspire compassion for
            the special needs and disability communities. After seeing how this
            simple mission has impacted so many lives we want to make sure that
            all educators can have access to The Hazelnut Books in their
            classroom if they so desire which is why we created the &ldquo;Books
            for Educators Program.&rdquo;

              Each story helps children see that every life has purpose, every
              story matters, and no one should walk their journey alone. These
              books are also used throughout our{' '}

          &ldquo;I am so inspired by this amazing mother and human, Julia
          Erman! I drove an hour to see her perform the Hazelnut Program at a
          school and she completely moved me. Her story is that of a true hero:
          grounded, resilient, and shaped by incredible life experiences. As a
          cancer survivor and mom of two children with ultra-rare diseases,
          Julia speaks with a strength and joy that is truly remarkable. She
          wears her story with pride, her head held high, and a smile that
          lights up a room. Her message is both heartfelt and to the point. She
          is authentic, engaging, and has a special gift for capturing
          kids&rsquo; attention with her energetic and fun personality. Julia
          also interacts beautifully with her audience, making everyone feel
          connected and seen.&rdquo;
