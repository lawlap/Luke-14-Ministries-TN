            by disability find community and connection to Jesus through His
            church.

            This purpose is the driving force behind all that we do. From
            providing services to celebrations, we aim to train and build
            infrastructure for those affected by disability both locally and
            globally.

          <p>
            Luke 14 Ministries was formed as a non-profit organization in
            August of 2017. The non-profit was formed to provide clarity of
            vision, accountability, and efficiency for several ministries God
            was developing to serve people affected by disability, both locally
            and globally.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we have continued to grow, we can see that God is at work
            through our ministry and our programs. We hope you will consider
            becoming part of our story!
